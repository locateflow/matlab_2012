Today I set up a way to run through each subunit of Bayliss and display all
its locations within the matrix of phrases that the bird sings.  This gives 
me an idea of the distribution of various subunits within the longer 
performance consisting of several phrases (~256).  At first glance it 
appears that subunits are strategically placed so that they are used at a 
consistent phrase to phrase frequency, though the other subunits each is 
partnered with may vary.
