Reviewing conversation with Ofer and Lucas last Wednesday.

Lucas says to start with something simple.  Let's just look at the histogram of 
interphrase intervals, based on phrases and based on elements.  We can pool across
elements for one bird.  Before combining them, divide by the mean interval.

I also need to work on viewing element distributions based on phrase markov models.
