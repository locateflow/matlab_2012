Riview of meeting with Ofer and Lucas:
11/07/2012

Write a quick abstract. Rewrite what we wrote previously.

Everybody looks at song types.  We see another structure.  If the bird is 
building his songs by reusing elements.  Is he remembering phrases or elements 
more saliently?  


Come up with 5 figures.
Figure 1 shows different phrases.

The figures tell a story.

Each figure answers a question but raises the next one.
Focus on the single message of the paper.

Which journal will we send it to?
    How general is our claim?
    Who is our target audience?
        Ornithologists?
        Neuroscientists?
        More general?
    Which journal?
        Animal Behaviour (ornithology)
        Neuroethology (if you have ideas that are more mechanistic)

For next time:
    1. Read old abstract quickly and write a new one.
    2. Put together five figures that tell a story.
    3. Make shuffled Markov Matrices.  Compare CV.
    4. Begin looking for other birds. (Say whether I ame optimistic we will find them.)
        find another bird 
    5. Try to look at how people previously study songs (maybe stupid).
        Literature search of how people look at songs.  Dietmar Todt.

aka: framework for the paper and statment about whether we can find more birds.

Also, think about our collaborators.
    David's motivation: the music.
    Also Hollis's motivation.

We are happy because we have a significant result and it's better than what we previously thought.
