Segmenting Johnson:  Maybe start at 1:50?
band pass filter 800-3000 highest steepness
 
Found the following notes in Daily Notes File on Google Docs:

looked at Butcher BIrds map in freemind.  Used branch from Oct 14 2011 for reference.  
opened 052.6-Powys1.  FIltered 800-3000.   Saved as mono.  
picked out a few "silences' with other bird sounds and used as clipboard data to filter out. 
cue points using following parameters from top to bottom: -30, .5, 3.5, 0-99 . 
now searching for table2startalign to figure out how to process the sound files.

also found:

"remembered a function called getDataFromWav.m.  
Also realized the name of file containing butcherbird functions is called functionsButcherbird.docx  
though I can't find where it is on the computer anymore.
Tried to run the function getDataFromWav with plowys sound files.  No luck.  
Error message in matlab having to do with rsmooth.  
December_6_2011 seems to be a helpful file showing what was done on previous birds.  
Thought probelms may be because I'm using matlab 2010 .  then I tried matlab 2008."

this time i did:
cue points using following parameters from top to bottom: -30, .5, 3.5, 0-99 .
Letters for 0, numbers for 99
edit > cue points > show cue lines.  so easier to make fine adjustments.

From Johnson I have 64 separate phrase files.

Ran getDataFromWav.  Fixing things through a couple glitches.
Moved consolidatebutcherbirdData to ButcherbirdFunctions folder.
also added to list in 
E:\C\Users\SongBird\Desktop\2_24_2012\Presentations\ButcherbirdResearchHist\WordFiles\functionsButcherbird

Move lmax and lmin functions to the MATLAB folder of the new computer.
