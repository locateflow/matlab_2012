Today I am looking to start processing another butcherbird sound file.  
I think I made a sheet or some notes about the process of working with
a butcherbirds sound file.  I found some information in the google 
spreadsheet that was used as a kind of daily log before.  Searched
the document for powyes.  Now I am locating the butcherbird mind map from 
the vaio computer and searching for informatiion there.

Gave up on finding that file.
