I have been collecting relavent data for all six butcherbirds.  Particularly
I had still been searching for Bayliss data.  I found it in two places.  
I found it in a google doc called Butcherbird Probabilities.  And now I found
it in a mat file: 
('C:\Users\Eathan\Documents\MATLAB\2012\04\April_18_2012.mat')
This file along with loading the appropriate data gives the graph of different
k statistics vs memory lengths using Bayliss:
