I was lookoing for the spreadsheet data for each bird previously put together.
I found that data in 2012/09/ElmentStructureForAllSixBirds

I added Johnson1 and Lumsdaine2 and saved a new data file with all birds in it.
I did something similar for all the structures made from the original wav files.
These are both saved in 2013/01/2013_01_21

I created a function to make a randomized phrase performance 1000 phrases long:
'function phraseModel = makeRandomPhraseModelFromElementMat(elementMat)'
