I need to create a figure that flows from highest CV to lowest CV.  From 
left to right it should proceed as follows:
Suffled, Avoid Repeats, Markov Model, Original Data.  To the right of that 
I want to provide data for the Permutated Markov Model to show that the CV
for elements increases again.

I should have two separate graphs: 
on top, a graph for elements.
on bottom a graph for phrases.

for phrase markov values I went to 2013_02_26\ShuffledMarkovEtc.mat\allBirdsCVElementPhrase
