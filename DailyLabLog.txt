Found the hand sorted data for Bayliss!  It was here on the 
external hardrive with files from the old vaio laptop:
E:\C\Users\SongBird\Documents\MATLAB\3_16_2012\Bayliss_clustered

I had a meeting with Ofer and Lucas.  Here are the tasks that we decided upon
pursuing:

1. Plot a histogram of inter-phrase intervals for each element.  Then compare that
with the histogram of the IPI for each element in the model.

2. We want to show that the element distribution shows more structure than the
phrase distribution.  Make barcode plots for the phrase distributions.  Compare
that with original data.

3. Make a Markov model that takes into account phrases.  interphrase interval
is zero when and element is used twice within a phrase.

Perhaps the coefficient of variation will be lower for the elements than the 
phrases?


Because more regular than exponential must be a memory???

Label phrases and make a transition matrix.

Work on:

Comparing the distribution of interphrase intervals for several elements/
Look at a way to exhibit the full phrase reusage in the same sort of barcode plot.
