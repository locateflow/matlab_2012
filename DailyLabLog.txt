try to use same bins in different histograms.
say every .5

check entropy, coeff of variance
H = sum(p.*log(p))

ipi = rand(1000,1)

h = hist(ipi, 0:0.5:15)
bar(xbin, h)
cv = std(x)/mean(x) (coefficient of variation)
p = h/sum(h) -> probability

Get randomized markov 
model together and do KS
test of element distribution compared to original.
also use original markov model.
compare ks statistics.

display entropy and coeff of variance on plots.

mode of distribution moved to the right implying there
is more regularity in the elements in 3 out of 6.
Ofer wants to do statistics across the birds.

The phrase based markov model makes the distribution
of element IPIs move right as well.  However would
the radomized markov model achieve this?
