butcherbird workflow

Find an appropriate sound file.
Band pass filter approx. 800-2500.
Remove as much background noise as possible w/o losing the signal.
use getDataFromWav.m to process the data.

The file called March_12_2012 has a process for creating images of the data.
The structures that contain the data that was already processed are in a mat file called 10_13_2011.mat

This outputs a structure with relevent info about the data.
Use imageButcherBird(struct, 'subsorting') to create an image of the sorted data.
Use rearrange_image_rows to hand sort the data.
Print out a sheet with the handsorted data.  Look for reused elements and give them labels.


Create a tab in the "Markov Matrix" spreadsheet in google docs.
Label the tab with the name of the bird.
Enter the values for the element names to label rows and columns.
Count the number of occurences in your sorted visualization for each element.

use imageButcherbird(struct, 'raw') to see and hear the songs in natural order.
In a spreadsheet redefine each phrase as a sequence of the elements you found.

What file helps turn the google docs data into matlab data that can be handled?
April_17_2012 ?  Yes, this is a problem.  Importing data that is all numbers and blank cells was difficult with Beasley Data.

If data is just numbers you can do Edit->Paste to Workspace.  No problem.

you need the data and a markov matrix
